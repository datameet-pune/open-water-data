This platform, an initiative of [Datameet](http://datameet.org/) and the [Centre for Internet and Society (CIS)](https://cis-india.org/) is an effort towards improvement of our collective knowledge of the water cycle. Water in India being a State subject is largely monitored only by government agencies. While much of the data they collect is difficult to access for the average citizen, many open datasets from remotely sensed imagery of Earth await exploration. Easy access to this data could facilitate more research and conversations on water science. A major hurdle though is the lack of technical knowledge to access this data. What if instead, we had access to a web platform, open, free, accessible to everyone and most importantly intuitive to understand to someone with little technical or programming knowledge.
